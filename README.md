# Description

It's my opinion that the player being able to handcraft, and mass produce complicated equipment on the fly is just not immersive. This mod aims to make outpost building more like shipbuilding. Expensive, but accessible.

With the exceptions of the armillary and commitment gift (which I will not be adding); the current version now includes everything in the build menu.

I also removed some of the research requirements. I kept research for the complicated pieces of equipment as a sort of "you need to be certified before we can sell this to you," kind of thing, but I removed the decor projects all together and removed all research requirements for:
storage containers,
advanced versions of the solar and wind power sources,
inter-system cargo link,
all furniture,
all decor,
and all displays.


I did not touch any quest-related or global value conditions.
